### **500/405 Error**

**Situation:**  
Our team was alerted by another department that a lot of 500 errors were being generated by one of our services built on a customized Spring Boot framework. These errors were affecting the platform’s performance and the customer experience. Despite code reviews and testing, we couldn’t figure out the root cause right away. Fixing this was urgent.

**Task:**  
I was assigned the task of finding the root cause of these 500 errors, fixing them quickly, and preventing them from happening again. It was important to handle this fast and ensure the service was responding to errors correctly.

**Action:**

1. **Investigating:**  
   I dug into the logs using ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to gather details about the 500 errors. Although the logs provided some clues, I needed to go deeper to find the exact cause. The errors were coming from a service we managed, so I focused on how it was handling requests.

2. **Finding the Root Cause:**  
   After a thorough examination, I discovered that the 500 errors were caused by a customer running multiple scripts, generating over 15,000 errors. The issue was with our Spring Boot framework. We hadn’t set up a proper 405 error (Method Not Allowed) for invalid operations, so the system defaulted to returning a 500 error, which incorrectly suggested a server issue instead of a client mistake.

3. **Fixing the Framework:**  
   I customized our Spring Boot framework by creating a new error handler that would return a 405 error when invalid operations occurred. This change helped the system correctly differentiate between server errors and client mistakes. I refined the exception handling logic to align with the overall system design.

4. **Deployment and Monitoring:**  
   After implementing the fix, I deployed the updated framework and monitored the system using Prometheus and Grafana to ensure everything was working properly. I also optimized our OpenSearch configurations to better handle large amounts of queries and reduce costs. This ongoing monitoring ensured the system stayed stable and that errors were classified correctly.

**Result:**  
The custom error handling solved the problem, getting rid of the 500 errors and making sure that invalid operations now triggered 405 errors. This fix improved the platform’s stability and performance while giving customers more accurate feedback. The other team confirmed that our fix had completely resolved the issue, showing how effectively our team could address complex technical challenges.

### **Dynamic Logging**

**Situation:**  
We were working on a Spring Boot application that used the ELK stack, but we faced problems with our static logging system. During times of high traffic, we struggled to manage the log volume, making it difficult to troubleshoot issues. Since the log levels were static, we couldn’t adjust the log detail in real time, which was a big problem for debugging. This wasn’t initially my responsibility, but I saw how it was affecting the team and decided to take ownership of the problem.

**Task:**  
My goal was to redesign the logging system so it could be flexible and dynamic. The solution needed to let us adjust log levels in real-time, making it easier to troubleshoot issues without hurting performance.

**Action:**

1. **Designing the Solution:**  
   I researched different ways to implement dynamic logging and decided to use Log4j2’s programmatic API. This allowed me to design a solution where log levels could be adjusted at runtime based on feature flags or manual overrides.

2. **Implementation:**  
   I built the `DynamicLogLevelService` and integrated it with a feature flag service, allowing log levels to be controlled through configuration files or environment variables. This made it easy to change log levels across different environments, like development, staging, or production.

3. **Manual Override API:**  
   I created a REST API that allowed the team to adjust the log levels in real time. This was especially useful during incidents when we needed to capture more details immediately for troubleshooting.

4. **Collaboration and Documentation:**  
   I documented how the new logging system worked so the team could easily understand and use it. I also worked with the DevOps team to make sure the new system integrated smoothly into our CI/CD pipeline and monitoring tools.

**Result:**  
The dynamic logging system became an essential part of our infrastructure. It allowed the team to troubleshoot issues in real-time, reduced unnecessary logging, and gave the DevOps team more control during critical incidents. This solution not only fixed the immediate problem but also scaled with the application as it grew. The success of this project led to its adoption in other services across the organization.

### **Conflict with Teammate**

**Situation:**  
Our team was designing a new feature for an internal application that needed to handle a high volume of real-time transactions. I strongly believed that **Amazon DynamoDB** was the best choice for this because it handles high-velocity data, scales automatically, and has low latency. However, one of my colleagues, who was in charge of database management, argued that **Amazon RDS** (a relational database) would be more cost-effective, even though it required more manual management to achieve similar performance. This created a conflict between prioritizing scalability and ease of use (DynamoDB) versus cost-efficiency (RDS).

**Task:**  
I advocated the use of DynamoDB, but I also need to consider my colleagues' concerns about cost and complexity. Therefore, I think we need to make a decision that balances performance and budget constraints.

**Action:**

1. **Evaluating DynamoDB’s Benefits:**  
   I thoroughly researched DynamoDB’s advantages for our use case, emphasizing its automatic scaling, ability to handle high write-throughput with low latency, and minimal operational overhead. Given the expected growth in transaction volume, I believed that DynamoDB’s flexibility and performance would justify its higher cost.

2. **Analyzing RDS’s Cost Efficiency:**  
   At the same time, I worked with my colleague to do a detailed cost analysis for both DynamoDB and RDS over the feature’s lifespan. We looked at storage, read/write capacity, and the ongoing operational management RDS would need. The analysis showed that RDS could meet our performance needs and would be about 30% cheaper in the first year.

3. **Open Discussion and Collaboration:**  
   I facilitated a discussion where we presented our findings to the team. I focused on DynamoDB’s long-term benefits, like reduced operational effort, while my colleague showed how RDS could handle our current needs more cost-effectively. We weighed the pros and cons together.

4. **Finding a Compromise:**  
   After considering all the data, we decided that starting with RDS would be the most practical approach. It balanced both cost and performance, especially in the early stages. We also made a plan to switch to DynamoDB if our transaction volume outgrew RDS’s capacity. This compromise allowed us to move forward while keeping our options open.

**Result:**  
By carefully evaluating both options and having open discussions, we made a decision that benefited the project overall. RDS was successfully implemented, meeting performance needs and saving around 30% in database costs compared to DynamoDB. The feature was delivered on time and within budget, and the flexibility of our plan allowed us to prepare for future scaling needs. This experience taught me the importance of listening to different perspectives and adapting to the best solution for the business.

### **Performance Optimization**

**Situation:**  
I was part of a team working on a new feature for an eCommerce platform. The project involved integrating a complex payment processing system that needed to be secure and scalable. However, we were facing significant delays because of performance issues with database queries, and the project was at risk of missing its deadlines. Even though I wasn’t the project lead, I noticed the team was struggling and decided to take ownership of the performance problems. I knew fixing this would help get the project back on track.

**Task:**  
My task was to address the performance bottlenecks, specifically by optimizing the database queries that were slowing down the payment processing system. I needed to make sure the system could handle the required load while still meeting security standards.

**Action:**

1. **Analyzing the Problem:**  
   I dived into the codebase to find out where the performance issues were happening. I worked closely with the database team to review the queries being run and found several inefficiencies. Some queries were running too often, fetching more data than needed, and not making good use of indexing.

2. **Optimizing the Queries:**  
   After identifying the bottlenecks, I optimized the most inefficient queries. I reduced the amount of data being fetched and improved the indexing strategies. I also added caching for frequently accessed data, which significantly reduced the number of database calls.

3. **Collaborating with the Team:**  
   Even though I wasn’t the lead, I communicated my findings and improvements to the rest of the team. I shared the optimizations I had made and explained how they would improve the system’s performance. I also made myself available to help other developers working on related parts of the project.

4. **Monitoring:**  
   I set up monitoring tools to track the performance of the optimized queries in real-time. This allowed us to quickly spot any new issues and fix them before they became bigger problems. I regularly checked the metrics to ensure the system was performing well under load.

**Result:**  
By taking ownership of the performance optimization, I improved the payment processing system’s response times by up to 40%. This unblocked other parts of the project, helping the team meet the revised deadline. Even though I wasn’t the official project lead, my proactive approach played a key role in turning the project around and ensuring its success. The project was delivered on time, and the client was happy with the result. This experience showed me that ownership isn’t about titles; it’s about stepping up, solving problems, and driving results.

**Fixed a Bug That Wasn’t Mine**

**Situation:**  
While working on a critical feature for our eCommerce platform, a new version of our application was deployed to production. The deployment included several new features, but soon after it went live, I noticed a bug in one of the core features that affected the checkout process. The bug hadn’t been caught during testing and was causing some users to have issues completing their purchases. Even though it wasn’t my responsibility to monitor production issues, I knew the checkout process was vital to the user experience, so I took ownership of the problem.

**Task:**  
My task was to find the root cause of the bug, fix it quickly to minimize its impact on users, and ensure the deployment was stable. Since this was a live production issue, time was critical, and I needed to resolve it without causing further disruption.

**Action:**

1. **Investigating the Bug:**  
   I started by reproducing the issue in our staging environment, which was similar to production. After running several tests, I identified that the bug was caused by a faulty validation check in the backend code. This error wasn’t handling certain edge cases properly, causing some transactions to fail during checkout.

2. **Implementing a Quick Fix:**  
   After finding the root cause, I immediately worked on a fix. I updated the validation logic to correctly handle the edge cases that were causing the failures. I tested the fix thoroughly in both the staging and production environments to ensure it resolved the issue without introducing new problems.

3. **Collaborating with the Team:**  
   Even though I took the lead on fixing the bug, I worked with the DevOps team to arrange a quick patch deployment to production. I also informed the QA team so they could run additional tests on the live system to confirm that everything was resolved. I made sure the whole team was on the same page, and the fix was deployed as smoothly as possible.

4. **Post-Deployment Monitoring:**  
   After the fix was deployed, I set up monitoring to track the checkout flow and make sure the bug didn’t reappear. I kept a close eye on the error logs and worked with customer support to let affected users know the issue was fixed.

**Result:**  
The fix was successfully deployed with minimal downtime, and the checkout process was back to normal. By taking ownership of the issue, I helped prevent further user frustration and potential revenue loss for the company. My quick action and collaboration ensured the bug was resolved without causing additional problems. This experience reinforced the importance of owning issues, even after deployment, and acting quickly to fix them when they arise.

### **Do Not Always Build Tools from Scratch**

**Situation:**  
Our team was tasked with developing a new feature for an internal tool that needed a complex data processing pipeline. The pipeline had to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from different sources into our system. Initially, the team planned to build the pipeline from scratch, which would have taken a lot of time and effort, especially with tight deadlines. However, I realized that we didn’t need to reinvent the wheel, as other teams in our organization had already built similar functionalities.

**Task:**  
My goal was to simplify the development process by reducing the amount of redundant work. Specifically, I wanted to find reusable components that could help us meet our objectives faster without compromising on quality. The aim was to save time and resources by reusing existing code instead of building everything from scratch.

**Action:**

1. **Research and Exploration:**  
   I started by looking through repositories from other teams in our organization. I reached out to colleagues in different departments who had worked on similar projects to see if they had developed reusable components. After reviewing several repositories, I found a solid ETL component that another team had built. It was well-documented, thoroughly tested, and had been used in production, making it a good candidate for reuse.

2. **Evaluation and Adaptation:**  
   I carefully evaluated the component to make sure it met our requirements. I ran tests to verify that it could handle our data sources and integrate with our existing architecture. Although it wasn’t a perfect fit, the core functionality was solid, and with a few adjustments, it could meet our specific needs.

3. **Integration:**  
   After confirming that the component was suitable, I integrated it into our project. I made the necessary code and configuration changes to align it with our requirements, saving us the effort of building the ETL pipeline from scratch. The integration went smoothly, and because the component was already tested and optimized, we were confident in its stability.

4. **Documentation and Sharing:**  
   To ensure that our team and others could benefit from this in the future, I documented the integration process and explained how the component could be reused for similar projects. I shared my findings and contributions with the original team and made our enhancements available to others within the organization.

**Result:**  
By reusing the ETL component from another team’s repository, I simplified our development process and allowed us to deliver the new feature ahead of schedule, saving around 30% of the estimated development time. Additionally, by reusing a stable component, we reduced the risk of introducing new bugs. This not only sped up our timeline but also allowed the team to focus on refining the feature instead of building the pipeline from scratch. This approach showed how collaboration and reusing existing solutions can make complex tasks easier and more efficient across the organization.

### **Monitoring Data Points**

**Situation:**  
As a software engineer, I’m often assigned simple tasks like adding monitoring data points for different client types in our product. These tasks are easy to implement but can be time-consuming because of the strict release process. For example, I was recently asked to add monitoring to report client type data to help the product team understand fulfillment rates across different platforms.

While this was a straightforward task, it involved more than just writing code. I had to go through a detailed approval process, create deployment plans, conduct load tests, and prepare reports. Even though the actual code change took just a few minutes, the whole process took two full days.

**Task:**  
I needed to find a way to streamline this process and improve the efficiency of adding monitoring data points. My goal was to cut down the time spent on repetitive tasks and avoid unnecessary delays while still following the release guidelines.

**Action:**  
To solve this, I designed and built a dynamic, configurable monitoring tool. Here’s what I did:

1. **Modular Design:**  
   I created a general-purpose monitoring component that could accept any data fields, like client type, channel type, or price range. The system could then map these fields to their respective charts and data lines using a JSON configuration stored in our configuration management system (similar to Apollo).

2. **Dynamic Configuration:**  
   Instead of hardcoding the monitoring data points, I made them configurable. By using a JSON configuration model, the product and operations teams could add or modify the monitoring fields without needing a full code release. These changes could be deployed quickly and take effect within minutes.

3. **Scalability:**  
   I designed the system to scale easily. It worked particularly well for scenarios like order fulfillment, where multiple data points might need monitoring, such as product types, discount types, or client types. Over time, the product team could enable monitoring for new fields without needing my involvement.

**Result:**  
The dynamic monitoring tool greatly improved our efficiency. What used to take two days now only took a few minutes. By moving the control to a centralized configuration, we reduced the need for constant code changes and releases. This not only improved our operational speed but also empowered non-technical teams to adjust monitoring as needed.

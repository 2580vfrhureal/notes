**Action:**

1. **Initial Investigation:**  
   I began by thoroughly investigating the logs using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to gather detailed information about the 500 errors. The logs provided some clues, but the root cause was still not evident. The errors were being flagged by another team because they originated from a service our team was responsible for. This prompted me to dive deeper into the specifics of how the service was handling requests.

2. **Identifying the Root Cause:**  
   After a detailed examination, I discovered that the 500 errors were being triggered by a customer who had inadvertently run a large number of scripts simultaneously, causing over 15,000 errors. I realized that the issue was rooted in our customized Spring Boot framework. Although we had tailored the framework to meet specific business requirements, we hadn’t explicitly defined a 405 error (Method Not Allowed) for cases where customers performed invalid operations. As a result, the system defaulted to returning a 500 error, which incorrectly indicated a server-side issue rather than a client-side misuse.

3. **Customizing the Framework:**  
   To resolve this, I extended our Spring Boot framework by implementing a custom error handler. I defined a specific exception that would correctly trigger a 405 error whenever an invalid operation was detected, ensuring that the system could accurately differentiate between server-side failures and client errors. This adjustment involved refining the exception handling logic within our service and ensuring it aligned with the overall architecture.

4. **Deployment and Monitoring:**  
   After implementing the changes, I deployed the updated framework and closely monitored the system using Prometheus and Grafana to confirm that the fix was effective.

**Question: Tell me about a time when you had to dive deep to solve a complex problem.**

**Situation:**  
In one of my recent projects, I was tasked with improving the logging system for a Spring Boot application that was integrated with the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). The existing logging configuration was static, making it difficult to troubleshoot issues effectively during high-traffic periods. This was especially problematic because our team needed to analyze logs in real-time for performance monitoring and debugging, and the overwhelming volume of logs made it hard to pinpoint specific issues. Additionally, the static logging levels meant that the system was either too verbose or not detailed enough, depending on the situation.

**Task:**  
My task was to implement a dynamic logging system that allowed the application to adjust its log levels at runtime. The goal was to ensure that during normal operations, the logging would be minimal (e.g., `INFO` level), but when debugging or handling critical issues, we could increase the verbosity (e.g., `DEBUG` level) without needing to restart the application. This would enable us to dive deep into specific issues quickly and efficiently while maintaining overall system performance.

**Action:**  
I started by analyzing the current logging configuration, which used Log4j2 with SLF4J, and determined that it lacked the flexibility to adjust log levels dynamically. After researching different approaches, I designed a solution that utilized Log4j2’s programmatic API, allowing us to change log levels at runtime. Here’s what I did:

1. **Feature Flag Integration:** I introduced a feature flag service that controlled whether dynamic logging was enabled. This flag could be toggled via a configuration file or an environment variable, providing flexibility in different environments (e.g., development, production).
2. **Log Level Adjustment Service:** I developed a `DynamicLogLevelService` that checked the feature flag and adjusted the log levels accordingly using Log4j2’s `LoggerContext`. This service also had a scheduled task that periodically checked the configuration, ensuring that log levels were always aligned with the current operational needs.

3. **REST API for Manual Overrides:** To give the team real-time control over the logging system, I implemented a REST API that allowed engineers to manually change the log level at runtime without needing to restart the application. This API was particularly useful during critical incidents where we needed to increase logging verbosity immediately.

4. **Integration with ELK Stack:** I ensured that all logs, regardless of their verbosity, were properly forwarded to Logstash, which processed them and sent them to Elasticsearch for storage and analysis. This allowed the team to query and visualize the logs in Kibana effectively, even when the log level was set to `DEBUG`.

**Result:**  
The implementation of dynamic logging significantly improved our ability to troubleshoot issues quickly and efficiently. We were able to reduce the overall volume of logs during normal operations, which improved system performance, while still being able to dive deep into specific issues when necessary by increasing the log level dynamically. This solution led to a 40% reduction in time spent analyzing logs during incidents and increased the team's confidence in identifying and resolving issues in production. Additionally, the REST API for manual log level control became a valuable tool for our DevOps team during incident response.

### **Amazon Leadership Principle: "Invent and Simplify"**

**Question: Describe a time when you invented something or simplified a process.**

**Situation:**  
The static logging system in our Spring Boot application was causing problems for the team. We either had too many logs, which made it difficult to find relevant information, or too few logs, which made it hard to troubleshoot issues. Additionally, changing log levels required a restart of the application, which was disruptive in production environments. I realized we needed a better solution that could dynamically adjust the log levels based on current needs without causing downtime.

**Task:**  
My task was to design and implement a system that simplified log management and allowed the team to adjust log levels at runtime without restarting the application. The goal was to make the logging system more flexible and responsive to the needs of the team.

**Action:**

1. **Simplification:** I created a `DynamicLogLevelService` that allowed log levels to be adjusted programmatically at runtime. This removed the need for application restarts when changing log levels and simplified the process of log management.

2. **Feature Flag Integration:** I integrated the logging system with a feature flag service, allowing the team to control logging levels through a simple configuration change or environment variable. This made it easy to enable or disable detailed logging across different environments without changing the code.

3. **REST API for Manual Control:** To further simplify the process, I implemented a REST API that allowed engineers to manually adjust log levels in real-time. This provided an intuitive and fast way to change logging verbosity during incidents.

4. **Documentation and Training:** I documented the new logging system and provided training to the team on how to use the new features. This ensured that everyone could take advantage of the simplified logging process.

**Result:**  
The new dynamic logging system simplified the process of managing logs in the application. The team no longer needed to restart the application to change log levels, which reduced downtime and improved overall

productivity. The feature flag integration made it easy to manage log levels across different environments, and the REST API provided a fast and intuitive way to adjust logging during incidents. The solution not only met the immediate needs of the team but also simplified the process of log management, making it more scalable and easier to maintain in the long run.

### **Amazon Leadership Principle: "Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit"**

**Question: Tell me about a time when you had a disagreement with a colleague or team member and how you handled it.**

**Situation:**  
We were in the process of designing a new feature for our internal application that needed to handle a high volume of real-time transactions. Given the scalability and performance requirements, I strongly advocated for using **Amazon DynamoDB**. From my experience, DynamoDB's ability to handle high-velocity data with low latency and automatic scaling made it the ideal choice for our use case. However, one of my colleagues, who was leading the database management team, argued that **Amazon RDS** (a relational database) would be a more cost-effective solution, even though it required more manual management to achieve similar performance. This created a conflict between choosing a solution that prioritized scalability and ease of use (DynamoDB) versus one that emphasized cost-efficiency (RDS).

**Task:**  
As the advocate for DynamoDB, my task was to make a strong case for why it was the right choice for this feature. However, I also needed to carefully consider my colleague's concerns about cost and operational complexity, and ultimately come to a decision that balanced both performance and budget constraints.

**Action:**

1. **Evaluating DynamoDB's Benefits:**  
   I started by thoroughly researching DynamoDB's advantages for our use case. I highlighted its automatic scaling, ability to handle high write-throughput with low latency, and minimal operational overhead. Given the anticipated growth in transaction volume, I believed that DynamoDB's flexibility and performance would outweigh the higher cost.

2. **Analyzing RDS's Cost Efficiency:**  
   At the same time, I acknowledged my colleague's concerns about the cost difference. I worked closely with him to perform a detailed cost analysis for both DynamoDB and RDS over the projected lifespan of the feature. We considered factors like storage, read/write capacity, and the ongoing operational management required for RDS. The analysis showed that while DynamoDB was technically superior in performance, RDS could meet our performance needs with significant cost savings—about 30% less expensive over the first year.

3. **Open Discussion and Collaboration:**  
   I facilitated a discussion where both of us presented our findings to the team. I emphasized that DynamoDB's automatic scaling could reduce long-term operational effort and allow the team to focus on feature development rather than database management. However, my colleague effectively demonstrated that RDS could handle the current and foreseeable load with the right optimizations, and the cost savings could be better utilized in other areas of the project.

4. **Agreeing on a Pragmatic Approach:**  
   After considering all the data, I recognized that starting with RDS would allow us to balance both cost and performance effectively, especially in the early stages of the project. We agreed to proceed with RDS for the initial implementation, but with a plan in place to migrate to DynamoDB if our transaction volume grew beyond RDS’s capacity. This compromise allowed us to leverage RDS’s cost advantages while keeping the option to switch to DynamoDB if needed.

**Result:**  
By taking the time to thoroughly evaluate both options and engaging in open, constructive discussions, we reached a decision that benefited the project as a whole. RDS was implemented successfully, meeting the performance requirements and saving approximately 30% in database costs compared to DynamoDB. The feature was launched on time and within budget, and the flexibility of the plan allowed us to monitor the system’s growth and prepare for potential scaling challenges in the future. This experience taught me the importance of listening to different perspectives, even when I had a strong initial preference, and of being willing to adapt to the best solution for the business.

No problem! You can still demonstrate **ownership** without being in a formal leadership position. Ownership at Amazon doesn’t necessarily mean you have to be a team lead or manager. It’s about stepping up, taking responsibility for tasks, and driving results, even when it’s not directly in your job description. Here’s a revised story reflecting ownership from an individual contributor perspective:

### **Amazon Leadership Principle: "Ownership"**

**Question: Can you describe a situation where you took ownership of a project that was failing? What actions did you take to turn it around?**

**Situation:**  
In one of my previous roles as a software developer, I was part of a team responsible for building a new feature for an eCommerce platform. The project involved integrating a complex payment processing system that needed to be both secure and scalable. However, the project began facing significant delays due to technical challenges, and the development efforts were not producing the desired results. Our team was struggling with performance issues related to database queries, and the project was at risk of missing critical deadlines.

Although I wasn’t the project lead, I saw that the project was in trouble and decided to take ownership of the performance issues, which were one of the main blockers for the team. I knew that resolving this problem could help get the project back on track.

**Task:**  
My task was to address the performance bottlenecks in the system, specifically focusing on optimizing database queries that were slowing down the payment processing flow. I wanted to ensure that the system could handle the required load while meeting the necessary security standards.

**Action:**

1. **Analyzing the Problem:**  
   I started by diving deep into the codebase to identify the specific areas where the performance issues were occurring. I worked closely with the database team to review the queries being executed and identified several inefficiencies in how data was being retrieved and processed. Some queries were running too frequently, fetching more data than necessary, and not taking full advantage of indexing.

2. **Optimizing the Queries:**  
   After identifying the bottlenecks, I took ownership of optimizing the database queries. I rewrote some of the most inefficient queries, reducing the amount of data being fetched and optimizing the indexing strategies. I also implemented caching for frequently accessed data, which significantly reduced the number of database calls.

3. **Collaborating with the Team:**  
   Although I wasn’t the lead, I communicated my findings and improvements to the rest of the team. I shared the optimizations I made and explained how they could improve the overall performance of the system. By proactively sharing these updates, I helped the team see progress in an area that had previously been a major obstacle. I also made myself available to assist other developers who were working on related parts of the system.

4. **Continuous Monitoring:**  
   I set up monitoring tools to track the performance of the optimized queries in real-time. This allowed us to quickly identify any new performance issues and address them before they became larger problems. I regularly checked the metrics and ensured that the system was performing as expected under load.

**Result:**  
As a result of taking ownership of the performance optimization, the payment processing system saw a significant improvement in response times—up to 40% faster. This helped unblock other parts of the project, allowing the team to meet the revised deadline. Although I wasn’t the official project lead, my proactive approach to solving the performance issues played a key role in turning the project around and ensuring its success. The project was delivered on time, and the client was satisfied with the outcome. This experience taught me that ownership isn’t just about titles or positions; it’s about stepping up when needed, solving problems, and driving results.

Here's how you can structure a story using the STAR method to answer a question about **ownership** when you discovered a bug after deployment, took responsibility, and fixed it.

### **Amazon Leadership Principle: "Ownership"**

**Question: Tell me about a time when you took ownership of a problem after it had already been deployed. What actions did you take to fix it?**

**Situation:**  
While working as a developer on a critical feature for our eCommerce platform, a new version of our application had just been deployed to production. The deployment included a number of new functionalities, but shortly after it went live, I noticed a bug in one of the core features that impacted the checkout process. This bug wasn’t caught during testing and was causing some users to experience issues when completing their purchases. Even though the bug had already been deployed, and technically it wasn’t my responsibility to monitor production issues, I knew that the checkout flow was a key part of the user experience and decided to take ownership of the problem.

**Task:**  
My task was to identify the root cause of the bug, fix it as quickly as possible to minimize the impact on users, and ensure that the deployment was stable. Since this issue affected the live production environment, time was of the essence, and I needed to resolve it without causing further disruption.

**Action:**

1. **Investigating the Bug:**  
   I started by reproducing the issue in our staging environment, which closely mirrored production. After running several tests, I identified that the bug was caused by a faulty validation check in the backend code that wasn’t handling certain edge cases properly. This validation error was causing some transactions to fail during the checkout process.

2. **Quick Fix Implementation:**  
   Once I identified the root cause, I immediately worked on a fix. I modified the validation logic to correctly handle the edge cases that were causing the failures. After making the changes, I tested the fix thoroughly in both the staging and production environments to ensure it resolved the issue without introducing any new problems.

3. **Collaborating with the Team:**  
   Although I was primarily responsible for fixing the bug, I communicated with the DevOps team to arrange a quick patch deployment to production. I also informed the QA team so they could run additional tests on the production system to confirm that the issue was fully resolved. I made sure everyone involved was on the same page, and that the fix was deployed as quickly and smoothly as possible.

4. **Post-Deployment Monitoring:**  
   After the fix was deployed, I set up monitoring to track the checkout flow and ensure that the bug was no longer occurring. I kept a close eye on the error logs and worked with the customer support team to ensure that users who had experienced issues were informed that the problem had been resolved.

**Result:**  
The fix was successfully deployed with minimal downtime, and the checkout process returned to normal operations. By proactively taking ownership of the issue, I was able to prevent further user frustration and potential revenue loss for the company. My quick action and collaboration with the team ensured that the bug was resolved without causing further disruption. This experience reinforced the importance of owning problems, even after deployment, and acting quickly to fix them when they arise.

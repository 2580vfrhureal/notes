### Core Concept in Java: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Java is a strongly object-oriented programming language, which means it heavily relies on concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

### ConcurrentModificationException

This exception occurs when a collection is modified while it is being iterated over, typically using iterators. For example:

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c"));
for (String s : list) {
    if (s.equals("b")) {
        list.remove(s); // This will throw ConcurrentModificationException
    }
}
```

### ClassCastException

This exception is thrown when an object is cast to a type that it is not an instance of. For example:

```java
Object x = new Integer(0);
String s = (String) x; // This will throw ClassCastException
```

### How HashMap Works Internally

HashMap in Java uses an array of buckets where each bucket is a linked list. When you add a key-value pair, a hash code is generated from the key, and the hash code determines the bucket where the entry will be stored. If two keys have the same hash code, they are stored in the same bucket but as separate nodes in the linked list.

### Adding Null Key to HashMap

HashMap allows one null key. The null key is always stored in the first bucket.

```java
Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put(null, "value");
```

### Comparable and Comparator

- **Comparable**: Used to define the natural ordering of objects. The class must implement `Comparable<T>` and override the `compareTo` method.
- **Comparator**: Used to define an external ordering of objects. A separate class can implement `Comparator<T>` and override the `compare` method.

```java
class MyClass implements Comparable<MyClass> {
    @Override
    public int compareTo(MyClass other) {
        return this.value - other.value;
    }
}

class MyComparator implements Comparator<MyClass> {
    @Override
    public int compare(MyClass o1, MyClass o2) {
        return o1.value - o2.value;
    }
}
```

### Generics Usage

Generics provide a way to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on types specified by the programmer. This adds type safety and reduces the need for type casting.

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("Hello");
// list.add(123); // Compile-time error
```

### When to Use Threads and Implementations

Threads are used to perform concurrent tasks. In Java, you can create a thread by:

- Extending the `Thread` class
- Implementing the `Runnable` interface
- Using the `ExecutorService`

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        // task code
    }
}

class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        // task code
    }
}
```

### Java Versions: 8 vs 17

Java 8 introduced lambdas, streams, and the new Date-Time API. Java 17 is an LTS (Long-Term Support) release with features like pattern matching for switch, sealed classes, and a preview of the foreign function and memory API.

### Functional Interface

A functional interface is an interface with exactly one abstract method, making it eligible for lambda expressions and method references.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunction {
    void apply();
}
```

### Multiple Properties Files in Spring

You can have multiple properties files in a Spring application. You can specify them using the `@PropertySource` annotation or in the `application.properties` file.

```java
@PropertySource("classpath:application.properties")
@PropertySource("classpath:additional.properties")
```

### Specifying Different Environments

Different environments (development, testing, production) can be specified using profiles in Spring.

```java
# application-dev.properties
spring.profiles.active=dev
# application-prod.properties
spring.profiles.active=prod
```

Use the `@Profile` annotation to specify beans for different profiles.
